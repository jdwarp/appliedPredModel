# Introduction:
Data are from the website http://fueleconomy.gov 
This is a problem in modeling/prediction.
The idea is this:  Fuel efficiency from 2010 and 2011 passenger cars and light trucks is provied.  Using data from 2010, find the best model to predict fuel effiency; fit the model using data from 2010, and evaluate model performance using 2011 data.  

Questions:  
1. Is there evidence of an improvement in fuel efficiency from 2010 to 2011?  
2. What variables are most significant predictors of fuel efficienty?  
3. Suggest ways in which fuel efficienty could be improved in future years.  drive type is significant use front wheel drive with only 2 wheels, and that CreeperGear should be left out. 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
library(dplyr)
```

data set: fuel economy from US Gov't website

```{r}
data(FuelEconomy)
library(lattice)

```
### Plot shown in the text:

load the data
FE is fuel economy

```{r}
cars2010 <- cars2010[order(cars2010$EngDispl),]
cars2011 <- cars2011[order(cars2011$EngDispl),]
cars2010a <- cars2010
cars2010a$Year <- "2010 Model Year"
cars2011a <- cars2011
cars2011a$Year <- "2011 Model Year"
plotData <- rbind(cars2010a, cars2011a)
plotTheme <- bookTheme(FALSE)
plotTheme$plot.symbol$col <- rgb(.2, .2, .2, .5)
plotTheme$plot.symbol$cex <- 0.7
trellis.par.set(plotTheme)

xyplot(FE ~ EngDispl|Year, plotData,
xlab = "Engine Displacement",
ylab = "Fuel Efficiency (MPG)",
between = list(x = 1.2))

```

## difference in mean fuel efficiency 2010 to 2011

$H_0$: no difference between FE in 2010 and 2011  
$H_A$: there is a difference in FE for years 2010 and 2011

We'll use a t-test for this inference:

```{r}
t.test(cars2010a$FE, cars2011a$FE)
```
## Answer #1
Between 2010 and 2011 there was no significant improvement in the vehicle fuel efficiancy. The cars in the sample data set from 2010 got 34.7 miles per gallon, compared to 34.73 MPG in 2011.The P-value of 0.96 is greater than 0.05, from the t-test, which demonstrates how there was no significant changes between values in 2010a and 2011a.
There was improvment between 2010 and 2012, and cars improved their MPG by an average of about 5 miles. In 2012 cars averaged 39.69 MPG. 

```{r}
# t test looks at mean of the two data sets and see how likely it is that they fall in the same distribution. 
t.test(cars2010a$FE, cars2012$FE)
#try to put two histograms on one plot using the par function
par(mrow=2)
hist(cars2010a$FE)
hist(cars2012$FE)


```


### variables in the data set:

```{r}
names(cars2010a)
```

try transmissons = AV, AM6 and AM7

```{r}
testTranny = filter(cars2010a, Transmission %in% c('AV','AM7'))
trannyModel = glm(FE ~ Transmission, data = testTranny)
summary(trannyModel)

print(mean(testTranny$FE))

```

Try adding air asperation method to see what it does..

```{r}
levels(cars2010a$ExhaustValvesPerCyl)
trannyValveModel = glm(FE ~ Transmission + ExhaustValvesPerCyl, data = testTranny)
summary(trannyValveModel)
```

## ANOVA

```{r} 

model1 = glm(FE~EngDispl+
              NumCyl +  
              AirAspirationMethod +
              TransCreeperGear +
              DriveDesc
    ,data=cars2010a)

summary(model1)

anova(model1)


```

It appears that TransCreeperGear is a drag, leave it out;
drive desc: front two wheel
```{r}
pruned2010a = filter(cars2010a, TransCreeperGear==0 &  DriveDesc=='TwoWheelDriveFront' & EngDispl < 3)

model2 = glm(FE~EngDispl, data=pruned2010a)

summary(model2)

anova(model2)


```

## Answer #2
TransCreeper Gear was shown to have a negative impact on MPG. Transmission type and Front Wheel Drive are significant predictors of improved fuel efficiency. 


make a prediction for 2011


```{r}
pred2011 = predict(model2, cars2011a)
#print(pred2011)
hist(pred2011)
boxplot(pred2011, main='data from 2011\nmodelall')

```



## compare average fuel efficiency for 2011 cars using model1 to fuel efficiency for all cars in 2010

```{r}
t.test(cars2011a$FE, pred2011)
```


##Answer 3

Earlier in the exercise we found two variables which were not impacting MPG or dragging MPG down. The goal is to minimize engine displacement, and get better Fuel Efficiency. To study further which factors influence fuel efficiency I reran the ANOVA model,under the name "model2"" , with additional variables: 

   "Transmission"   "TransLockup"      "NumGears"    "TransLockup"      "IntakeValvePerCyl"   "ExhaustValvesPerCyl"   "VarValveTiming"      "VarValveLift"    

```{r}
model2 = glm(FE~EngDispl+ NumCyl + AirAspirationMethod + Transmission  + NumGears + TransLockup +  TransCreeperGear + DriveDesc + IntakeValvePerCyl + ExhaustValvesPerCyl + CarlineClassDesc + VarValveTiming + VarValveLift ,data=cars2011a)

summary(model2)

anova(model2)
```

These variables were significant in improving MPG:
TransmissionA4 
DriveDescTwoWheelDriveFront  
CarlineClassDescSmallPickupTrucks2WD   
VarValveTiming  


These variables made no significant impact to MPG:  
IntakeValvePerCyl    
ExhaustValvesPerCyl
VarValveLif
